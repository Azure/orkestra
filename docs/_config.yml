  Orkestra is a cloud-native release orchestration and lifecycle management (LCM) platform for fine-grained orchestration a group of inter-dependent “Applications”. An “Application” may be defined as a Helm chart or artifact, with or without subchart dependencies. Orkestra works by generating a DAG workflow from the ApplicationGroup spec. to orchestrate the deployment and upgrade of multiple applications within a Kubernetes cluster. At a finer-grain, Orkestra can also order the deployment of subcharts within an application chart by generating an embedded DAG workflow.
