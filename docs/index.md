Orkestra is a cloud-native release orchestration and lifecycle management (LCM) platform for fine-grained orchestration a group of inter-dependent *"Applications"* (and their inter-dependent subcharts). An *"Application"* may be defined as a [Helm](https://helm.sh/) chart or artifact, with or without [subchart](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_dependency) dependencies.

Sophisticated applications require **intelligent** release orchestration and lifecycle management that is not supported by Helm.

Orkestra works by generating a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) workflow from the `ApplicationGroup` spec. to orchestrate the **deployment** and in-service **upgrades** of multiple applications within a Kubernetes cluster. At a finer-grain, Orkestra can also order the deployment of subcharts within an application chart by generating an embedded DAG workflow.

Orkestra leverages popular and mature open-source frameworks like [Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo/) (Workflows), [Flux Helm Operator](https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-operator) and [Chartmuseum](https://chartmuseum.com/)

## Use Cases üíº

### Reliable (continuous) "Deployment" and in-service "Upgrades" of mission-critical applications

üì± *5G Core* [Network Functions](https://www.sdxcentral.com/resources/glossary/network-function/) (NFs)üì± are 5G applications that rely on a rich ecosystem of **infrastructure** and **PaaS** (platform-as-a-service) components to be up and ready before the Network Functions can be successfully started. This establishes a hard dependency between the NFs and the infra/paas applications. Orkestra solves the dependency problem by honoring these dependencies by using a DAG workflow to deploy the infra/paas components prior to starting the NF application. This also allows for the independent lifecycle management of the infra/paas components and groups of NFs.

## Architecture üèó

To learn more about how Orkestra works see the [architecture](./architecture.md) docs

## Installation üß∞

For getting started you will need,

- A Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` - Kubernetes client
- `helm` - Helm client
- `kubebuilder` - [installation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start.html#installation)
- `controller-gen` - `GO111MODULE=on go get -v -u sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools/cmd/controller-gen@v0.5.0` (this should be run from outside the Orkestra (go module) repo for it to be installed to your `$GOBIN`)
- (_optional_) `argo` - Argo workflow client (follow the instructions to install the binary from [releases](https://github.com/argoproj/argo/releases)

Install the `ApplicationGroup` and custom resource definitions (CRDs)

Install the orkestra controller and supporting services like, Argo Workflow, Flux Helm-operator and Chartmuseum using the provided helm chart

```shell
helm install orkestra chart/orkestra/  --namespace orkestra --create-namespace
```

You should see resources spin up in the _orkestra_ namespace as shown below,

```shell
> kubectl get all -n orkestra
